If you need multiple instances for one basex on an Apache server here is the vhost.conf file:
<VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerAdmin xxxxxxx
        ServerName www.xxxxxxxxx.fr
	      ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyRequests off
        ProxyPass / http://194.254.168.33:81/xxxxx/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://194.254.168.33:81/xxxxxx/
</VirtualHost>


- Please keep in mind all pathes of the xqm files need to match the xxxxxx URL
